# DeFi-Empire 
## Overview
Welcome to the "DeFi-Empire" project, a decentralized finance initiative that introduces the ERC20 token "drunk" (D) and a secure Vault contract. D follows the ERC20 standard, facilitating decentralized transactions with features such as total supply tracking, balance management, and events for transfers and approvals. The Vault contract, interacting through the IERC20 interface, provides a secure platform for users to deposit and withdraw funds, earning proportional shares. This foundation enables transparent and secure decentralized financial activities within the DeFi-Empire project, allowing users to conduct efficient transactions on the blockchain.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following prerequisites before proceeding:

- Linux Operating System

1. Create Avalanche Subnet
```
avalanche subnet create binod
```

3. Deploy Subnet
```
avalanche subnet deploy binod
```
3. Configure Metamask
- Add network details to Metamask for seamless interaction.

4. Deploy ERC20 and Vault Contracts using Remix
- Copy the ERC20 and Vault contract code into Remix and deploy the contracts.

5. Interact with Contracts
